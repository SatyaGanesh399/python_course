ALGORITHM
    step by step procedure to solve the problem.

characteristics
    1. independent - of programming language
    2. definite - easy to understand

criteria
    1. input - finite number of inputs
    2. output - finite number of outputs
    3. finiteness -  should complete a definite time
    4. definiteness - output should not change for same input for any number of executions

steps to design the algorithm
    1. device an agorithm -  find the best technique to implement
    2. validation - checks if the algo gives proper output/correct answer
    3. Analysis of algo - check for time to complete and space to store data during execution is spent on the algorithm


Time Complexity :
    sum of frequency count of each instance of the algorithm and the computations performed
    example : 
        sum = 0;
        for(i=0; i<num; i++)
        {
            sum = sum + i;
        }
        
        i=0(initialization)
        i = 1;
        i = 2;........i = n;, i = n+1;
